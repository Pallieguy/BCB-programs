# B/CB-programs
The assorted programs I've made in my tenure in the B/CB field.

Working is a directory for incomplete/untested code.  Once it is completed it gets moved to the appropriate directory and instructions are added to MassCompile.

MassCompile requires a chmod +x untill I write a proper makefile.
